# Hypothesis-testing-with-R
200	mice	received	a	treatment	“Nutritional	Supplement”	for 6	months.	We	want	to	know	
whether	the	treatment	has	an	impact	on	the	weight	of	the	mice.	
Another	200	rats	received	the	same	treatment, but	results	seem	to	differ.
To	answer	to	this	question,	the	weight	of	the	mice	has	been	measured	before	and	after	the	
treatment.	This	gives	us	200	sets	of	values	before	treatment	and	200	sets	of	values	after	
treatment	from	measuring	twice	the	weight	of	the	same	mice, and	another	200	sets	of	values	
before	treatment	and	200	sets	of	values	after	treatment	from	measuring	twice	the	weight	of	the	
same	rats.
Therefore we will create a dataset for the rats and mice and test them based on these criteria:
 T-test	statistic
 Degrees	of	freedom
 P-value
 Confidence	Interval
 Sample	estimates
